1.  Change your current working directory to laptop-as-master

2.  Make sure you already installed the required modules

        npm install noble

3.  Start a Node.js REPL

        node

4.  Make sure you already have the BLE slave device advertising itself

5.  Make sure your computer has BLE (Bluetooth Smart / Bluetooth 4.0) support

6.  Type the following line into Node.js REPL to execute index.js

        require('./index.js')

7.  If you see "Two characteristics for TX and RX is OK now" without any error,
    you can try to send data to the Tessel board now...

8.  Type the following command to send some bytes to Tessel board

        rx.write(new Buffer([0x03, 0x02, 0x01, 0x00]));

9.  If you have a console/terminal connected to the Tessel board,
    you should see that four bytes 03020100 was sent to RX, and
    the same bytes is echoed back from TX...
