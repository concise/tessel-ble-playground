need spec documents so that we can do DIY/ODM/OEM...
- what features do we actually want precisely ???
- what does a good sensor circuit look like ???
- the power consumption of sensor ???
- the power consumption of bluetooth advertisement ???
- do we only need one-way communication (BLE beacon) ???
- what application logic do we want to deploy on the hardware ???
- how to customized a hardware (for example, we will need to assign each hardware a unique human readable name, the settings should be stored persistently across system reboots) ???
