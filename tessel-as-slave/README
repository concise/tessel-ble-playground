1.  Change your current working directory to tessel-as-slave

2.  Make sure you already installed the required modules

        npm install ble-ble113a

3.  The program assumes you connect the BLE module to the port B on a Tessel board.
    If that is not the case please change index.js accordingly.

4.  Run the code on the Tessel board that is currently connected to your computer

        tessel run index.js

5.  Note that to avoid bundling unnecessary files to Tessel make sure
    you know what the commands `tessel run` and `tessel push` do...
    See  https://tessel.io/docs/cli#deploying  for more information.
